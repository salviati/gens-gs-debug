== Profiling Sega Genesis Code ==
- Compile your code with -pg and include gens.s in your project. Keep the elf file.
- Remember to start profiling monitor at some point; ex: ```monstartup(0, 0x400000)```
- When you exit the emulator or call ```moncleanup()``` in your code, "gmon.out" will be written.
- Use the m68k-elf cross gprof to get listings, ex: ```m68k-elf-gprof myrom.elf```
